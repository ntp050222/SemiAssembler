  abstract = {Atlas is a suite of programs developed for assembly of genomes by
	a "combined approach" that uses DNA sequence reads from both BACs
	and whole-genome shotgun (WGS) libraries. The BAC clones afford advantages
	of localized assembly with reduced computational load, and provide
	a robust method for dealing with repeated sequences. Inclusion of
	WGS sequences facilitates use of different clone insert sizes and
	reduces data production costs. A core function of Atlas software
	is recruitment of WGS sequences into appropriate BACs based on sequence
	overlaps. Because construction of consensus sequences is from local
	assembly of these reads, only small (<0.1\%) units of the genome
	are assembled at a time. Once assembled, each BAC is used to derive
	a genomic layout. This "sequence-based" growth of the genome map
	has greater precision than with non-sequence-based methods. Use of
	BACs allows correction of artifacts due to repeats at each stage
	of the process. This is aided by ancillary data such as BAC fingerprint,
	other genomic maps, and syntenic relations with other genomes. Atlas
	was used to assemble a draft DNA sequence of the rat genome; its
	major components including overlapper and split-scaffold are also
	being used in pure WGS projects.},

	every consensus base. The PCAP program was tested on a mouse whole-genome

	(or scaffolds). For example, analysis of the D. melanogaster genome
	yielded approximately 98\% coverage with an N50 contig length of
	324 kb and an N50 supercontig length of 5143 kb. The assembly accuracy
	was high, although not perfect: small errors occurred at a frequency

	2.6 gigabases in size, of which 90\% of these bases are in 479 scaffolds.
	For the mouse genome, which is a large and repeat-rich genome, the
	input dataset was designed to include a high proportion of paired
	end sequences of various size selected inserts, from 2-200 kbp lengths,
	into various host vector templates. Phusion uses sequence data, called
	reads, and information about reads that share common templates, called
	read pairs, to drive the assembly of this large genome to highly
	accurate results. The preassembly stage, which clusters the reads
	into sensible groups, is a key element of the entire assembler, because
	it permits a simple approach to parallelization of the assembly stage,
	as each cluster can be treated independent of the others. In addition
	to the application of Phusion to the mouse genome, we will also present
	results from the WGS assembly of Caenorhabditis briggsae sequenced
